## Introduction:

Array is a linear datastructure that stores a collection of elements of the same data type.
Elements are allocated in contiguous memory, allowing for constant-time access.
Each element has a unique index number.


## Types of Arrays:
- One-dimensional Array
- Multi-dimensional Array

## Operations on Array:
- Traversal:
  Iterating through the elements of an array.
- Insertion:
  Adding an element to array at a specific index.
- Deletion:
  Removing an element from array at a specific index.
- Searching:
  Finding an element in the array by its value or index.

## Applications of Array:
- Storing data in a sequential manner
- Implementing queues, stacks and other data structures
- Representing matrices and tables.

Note: 
- Arrays store data in contiguous memory locations, which makes deletion and insertion very difficult to implement. 
  This problem is overcome by implementing linked lists, which allow elements to be accessed sequentially.
